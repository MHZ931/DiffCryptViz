# DiffCryptViz - Visualizer for Differential Cryptanalysts

## What is this?
A personal project I made to visualize some toy ciphers for people to understand differential cryptanalysis better.

Currently implemented:
- SKINNY

Planned:
- GIFT

## Why did you do this?
Personally, I find differential cryptanalysis quite difficult to get into. The most part of it consists of statistical analysis. However, people who would like to get into cryptography are likely discouraged by the fact that most of the time it doesn't always yield a deterministic solution (unlike CTFs). This project serves as a soft opening for those who would like to dive in, but are also hesitant about the complexity of this topic.

Again, this is only my own assumption. I believe everyone sees this topic differently. But I'd be very glad if this can help you, even by a very small friction. Also this is a project where I want to practice using Javascript.

## This project uses:
- https://iacr.org/authors/tikz/ for making all the LaTeX and TikZ codes available
- [benrbray/tikzjax](https://github.com/benrbray/tikzjax)
